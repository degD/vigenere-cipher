2022/07/08 - Seventeenth birthday!

What an achievement it is to keep a documentation project in such good health for so many years, in a field that sees significant change and advancement every day! Such a feat does not happen autonomously though (not yet): dozens of enthusiastic humans volunteer some of their precious time and knowledge every month to boost the ArchWiki back to its orbit, so thank you all! And today is an excellent opportunity to mention in particular two members of the ArchWiki:Maintenance Team, User:Nl6720 and User:NetSysFire, who have been giving their help for respectively 1706 and 538 days continuously! Kudos, kudos, kudos, and love :D

2022/04/13 - New maintainer and translator

We are happy to welcome User:Erus Iluvatar to the ArchWiki:Maintenance Team after their hard work and long-term investment in the wiki. Additionally, in recognition of their efforts to translate the French ArchWiki (which has now returned to our "home base" after being previously hosted on archlinux.fr), User:Erus Iluvatar is conferred the role of official translator. Thank you and keep up the good work!

2021/09/25 - New maintainer

With great pleasure we announce that Flyingpig officially joins the Maintenance Team. Thank you for your hard work and welcome to the team!

2021/07/08 - 0x10th foundation anniversary

Another year, another massive amount of changes that Arch Linux and the software that we redistribute made, but we have been here to document them all. As we inaugurate the fifth bit in ArchWiki's years-of-age counter, we wish to also distribute tonnes of gratefulness to all the awesome humans and bots who contributed so far: let us continue more determined than ever, all together!

— Kynikos (talk) 04:58, 8 July 2021 (UTC)
2021/03/19 - New maintainer

We are happy to welcome a new reinforcement to the Maintenance Team. The honour goes to NetSysFire, whose enthusiasm and commitment improved the wiki in the past several months. Thank you and keep up the good work!

— Lahwaacz (talk) 18:23, 19 March 2021 (UTC)
2020/07/08 - ArchWiki's birthday

As alive and avant-garde as always, this project and the vibrant community of people that animates it have grown another year stronger, this time breaking the record of registered users, with more than 4700 new accounts created, almost as many as the previous two years together! A good excuse to go have a drink (perhaps via video conference) with a couple of friends and brag about being an awesome ArchWiki contributor, well done everyone!

— Kynikos (talk) 14:52, 8 July 2020 (UTC)
2020/06/06 - New maintainer and translators

Some great news for our community, we are pleased to announce the appointment of Blackteahamburger as a new member of the ArchWiki:Maintenance Team, in reward for his recent valuable contributions to the project. Blackteahamburger himself and Duodai have also been conferred the role of official translators to recognize their enthusiastic efforts in improving the accessibility of the wiki to speakers of other languages. Thank you, keep up the good work!

— Kynikos (talk) 15:25, 6 June 2020 (UTC)
2019/07/08 - 14 years of ArchWiki

Today this wiki is one year older than last year, more than 2000 pages larger than last year, and more than 47000 edits better than last year. Many thanks to the thousands of people who keep the wiki rolling with an amazing pace of 130 edits per day on average!

Today we also welcome a new reinforcement to the Administration Team. After being the most active maintainer in the past months or even years, nl6720 has naturally progressed towards gaining even more superpowers for improving the wiki in new ways. Thank you for your work and congratulations!

— Lahwaacz (talk) 11:17, 8 July 2019 (UTC)
2018/12/16 - Official translators

Translating our most important articles, and in some cases many more of them, into languages other than English is a remarkable work that has always been conducted quite a bit in the background in the community, sometimes within a self-organized Translation Team, other times simply by passionate individual efforts. The Administrators fully support translation work, as long as it is conducted in a way that is compliant with the wiki's general language-agnostic style and editing rules, starting from Help:i18n. To give it official acknowledgement, a new "translator" role has been introduced to thank and symbolically reward users who have made and will make the greatest contributions towards this goal.

The initial selected translators are (in alphabetical order): AlonsoLP, ArchLinuxUser, Fengchao, Josephgbr, Kusakata, MrReDoX, Pedro, SlavMetal, Tuxpain. Some notable historical, though currently inactive translators have also been awarded the role: Agent0, Blackx, Hilinus, Kycok, Maveloth, Skydiver, Umby213, Veleno77, Vladimir Shatalin.

It must be noted that the official "translator" role is independent from the membership in a Translation Team: some languages may not have enough users to constitute a team, nonetheless exceptional individual efforts will still be recognized; equally, membership in a Translation Team is not subject to the assignment of the "translator" role: the teams are still completely free and even encouraged to independently invite more users to join, in an effort to better coordinate the translation work; the most active members will eventually be awarded the official role. Novice translators will also hopefully benefit by seeking advice and guidance from the experience accumulated by the official translators.

Again, thanks to all wiki translators for your help to overcome language barriers to make the ArchWiki available to as many people as possible!

2018/12/14 - 404 Award

Today is time to single-out one of the extraordinary wiki engagements. This has been dubbed the "404 Award", because the wiki would have had to go offline for a day to stop nl6720 from improving it with contributions on every single of the past 404 days. Thank you! On this opportunity a due thank you also goes out to the Arch Linux DevOps team for keeping watch over and tuning the system!

— Indigo (talk) 16:01, 14 December 2018 (UTC)
2018/07/08 - 13 years working together

Today marks thirteen years of contributions to this project, many thanks to all the fresh and experienced users who decided to share some of their time and knowledge here!

— Kynikos (talk) 16:00, 8 July 2018 (UTC)
2018/01/07 - New maintainers

Thank you Kewl and Svito for accepting to join the ArchWiki:Maintenance Team, keep up the wonderful work that you have been doing so far!

— Kynikos (talk) 05:01, 7 January 2018 (UTC)
2018/01/06 - New administrator

The new year brings fresh forces into the Administration Team: thanks to the experience and trust earned by loyally serving the ArchWiki for a long time as an official Maintainer, enriching it with thousands of contributions, Lonaowna has been given administrator rights with the confidence that his help will be of great value to prolong and advance the prosperity of our cherished project. Congratulations!

— Kynikos (talk) 15:04, 6 January 2018 (UTC)
2017/07/08 - Happy Birthday ArchWiki

Hey everybody, today the ArchWiki turns 12! You can try to sing Happy Birthday to your screen, but it's unlikely that our server will understand your good-hearted feelings... As an alternative, try to make a small gift edit, it's very easy, and if you don't know how to do it, ArchWiki:Contributing can give you some inspiration :) Many thanks to all those who spent some of their time here during the last year, let's all keep supporting this project!!

— Kynikos (talk) 11:05, 8 July 2017 (UTC)
2017/06/29 - New maintainer

Congratulations to Larivact, who today was given maintainer rights thanks to his recent contributing efforts: keep up the good work!

— Kynikos (talk) 17:20, 29 June 2017 (UTC)
2016/10/05 - New maintainers

The Maintenance Team gains new blood in the form of User:Edh, User:Francoism, and User:nl6720 (in alphabetical order). Your continuous efforts to improve ArchWiki are more than appreciated — not only by the maintenance team, but by a wide range of GNU/Linux users which benefit from our wiki every day. Thanks!

— Alad (talk) 11:53, 5 October 2016 (UTC)
2016/07/08 - 11 years of ArchWiki

Today the wiki celebrates 11 years of activity, an amazing accomplishment for a project that is kept alive solely by volunteer contributions! As it has always been, there's a lot going on even right now while you're reading: in particular you should be aware that the Beginners' guide and the Installation guide are just about to be unified into a single article, after years of attempts and small shifts towards this goal; if you want to participate, see what's happening in Talk:Beginners' guide, and possibly also refer to the mailing-list thread or the special wiki birthday forum thread. And don't forget the brand-new #archlinux-wiki channel if you feel more at ease on IRC.

If you have ever authored an edit in any of our thousands articles, even if only once, even if only to make a small correction, thank you!!! The value of this work is the sum of innumerable small contributions from people who don't follow the "somebody else will fix it" philosophy: most people here are not PhD's in Computer Science, we simply share a passion for Arch Linux, the broader FOSS community and pretty much anything related to the digital computing world, therefore if you think this sounds like you but you've never bothered creating an account, take the few seconds needed to do it now, and start sharing your skills and knowledge, whatever their size is; you will find that the more you contribute, the more you will learn and improve yourself too, so it's a win-win choice ;)

Anyway, Happy Birthday ArchWiki, and everybody keep up the good work!

2016/05/22 - IRC channel

ArchWiki now has a dedicated IRC channel to ask questions surrounding articles, and the wiki itself. Please join us at #archlinux-wiki on Libera Chat, of course always keeping the three fundamental rules in mind when editing the wiki. For more information, see ArchWiki:IRC.

— Alad (talk) 01:23, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
2016/05/15 - New administrator

The ArchWiki has thousands of articles, and hundreds of different users edit it every month: keeping the whole project together, ensuring that it always sails in strict accordance to Arch's principles, is a task that requires a great deal of organizational work behind the scenes. As an official Maintainer for a long time, Indigo has gained plenty of experience, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of how the wiki is structured and regulated by its internal policies, therefore today he is officially promoted to the Administration Team, granting him full power to unleash all his skills where needed :) Thank you for your hard work!

— Kynikos (talk) 04:28, 15 May 2016 (UTC)
2016/03/19 - New maintainers

After several months of high-quality contributions, Pypi and Rdeckard have been welcomed as members of the official ArchWiki:Maintenance Team, congratulations!

— Kynikos (talk) 04:33, 19 March 2016 (UTC)
2016/02/03 Account creation issues

During these days you may be finding it impossible at times to register a new account: this is deliberately done by the staff due to maintenance necessities, not a bug to be reported. If you are affected by this issue, please try registering again every few hours, until successful. Trying our best to restore the service to full and continuous operation as quickly as possible, we truly apologize for this inconvenience.

— Kynikos (talk) 07:57, 3 February 2016 (UTC)

Update 02:12, 6 February 2016 (UTC): see also Unable to determine correct answer for wiki account registration.
2015/10/02 - New maintainers

As a result of their long-term commitment and valuable contributions, Det, Kycok, Neitsab and Silverhammermba (in alphabetical order) have entered the official ArchWiki:Maintenance Team. Thank you for your help!

— Kynikos (talk) 15:18, 2 October 2015 (UTC)
2015/07/08 - ArchWiki turns 10!

Exactly 10 years ago, on July 8th 2005, the ArchWiki was installed with the MediaWiki engine: since then, more than 20,000 users created their account and made almost 400,000 edits that evolved the initial blank page into this fantastic documentation resource that innumerable Arch and non-Arch Linux users every day browse from all around the world.

For the future, several major improvements are already under discussion or planning in various talk pages, with Help talk:I18n#Language namespace(s) in place of suffixes?, ArchWiki:Requests#Should we remove or archive obsolete articles? or ArchWiki talk:Maintenance Team#Reorganization being only some notable examples. For this anniversary, ArchWiki:Statistics has been expanded, and many more ideas have been brought up in its talk page to better show the evolution of the wiki and try to give something back to the most active contributors.

If you did not make it to get involved in the community of contributors in the past decade, you are very welcome to become one of the first ones of the decade that has just started! The wiki syntax is very easy to learn and use, you can find an introduction in Help:Editing, and ArchWiki:Contributing is there to give you plenty of inspiration about how and where to start. If you have any questions, just ask in the talk page of one of those pages, or any other that suits your specific issue, and the wiki staff, or possibly other proactive users, will try their best to give you a quick and accurate answer.

Well, Happy Birthday ArchWiki, then! The celebrations will go on until the weekend, as for example the 11th is the anniversary of the first edit: if you want, you can take this chance to make a small gift edit to your favorite article ;) Let's keep working together to make this project grow better and better for the next 10 years and more, thanks everybody!

2015/05/24 - Restyled AUR template

Template:AUR has been restyled with the addition of an "AUR" superscript to make AUR packages look different from official ones: this has the consequence that almost all articles mentioning AUR packages now have a redundant "from the AUR" wording that needs to be removed. In the same fashion, the "from the official repositories" wording associated to official packages is deprecated.

Describing how to install a package is still forbidden by Help:Style#Package management instructions but, for both official and AUR packages, you can use the "install" word as a link, e.g. [[Install]], to point users to the centralized package installation instructions.

This change was discussed and voted in Help talk:Style#Pkg and AUR templates: add icon, make them look different.

— Kynikos (talk) 02:41, 24 May 2015 (UTC)
2015/04/24 - New administrator

Congratulations to Alad on his promotion to Administrator, naturally following his long streak of exemplary contributions to the articles and proactive, all-round participation in the organization of the wiki, which will now be able to benefit even more greatly from the experience he gained while serving as an official Maintainer.

— Kynikos (talk) 13:53, 24 April 2015 (UTC)
2015/04/19 - New maintainer

Today the ArchWiki:Maintenance Team gains the help of Chazza, who distinguished himself for the quality of his work in the wiki, thank you!

— Kynikos (talk) 03:28, 19 April 2015 (UTC)
2014/12/22 - Adopt an article

The ingredients of a healthy and successful wiki are both the addition of fresh, up-to-date content (the "attack"), but also protection from counter-productive edits (the "defense"). While "attacking" may be the most entertaining part, please be aware that helping "defend" the ArchWiki is of invaluable importance and fortunately also extremely easy! Just add a bunch of your favorite articles to your watchlist and follow their changes, taking action when necessary: the wiki will receive your love with gratitude :) See ArchWiki:Contributing#The most important task for a more extensive introduction.

— Kynikos (talk) 15:13, 22 December 2014 (UTC)
2014/10/31 - Unintelligible edits

This news entry is a reminder that edits that do not respect the 3 fundamental contributing rules may be reverted without previous warning, especially on popular articles. The ArchWiki is a shared resource within the Arch community, and users who do not understand this concept, and treat wiki articles like they would with their own personal blog, are invited to spend their time somewhere else. Thank you for choosing to respect your fellow Archers, keep up the good work everybody!

— Kynikos (talk) 14:48, 31 October 2014 (UTC)
2014/08/03 - New administrator

With great pleasure we announce that Lahwaacz has gained his seat at the command table, very well deserved after tirelessly serving our community with more than a year of innumerable, high-quality contributions that have certainly played a big part in the continuous effort we all make to preserve the ArchWiki as one of the best Linux documentation sources currently available. Congratulations!

— Kynikos (talk) 02:45, 3 August 2014 (UTC)
2014/07/20 - New maintainers

Today the ArchWiki:Maintenance Team can count on the contribution of two new users: Alad and Indigo. Thank you for the effort you are spending on the wiki!

— Kynikos (talk) 07:14, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
2014/03/13 - New maintainer

We are happy to announce that Lonaowna has joined forces with the other members of the ArchWiki:Maintenance Team. Keep up the good work!

2013/12/09 - Code templates are fixed

Template:bc and Template:hc have been adapted to work like before they broke. No fixes are required anymore.

— Kynikos (talk) 05:15, 9 December 2013 (UTC)
2013/12/08 - MediaWiki 1.22.0 has broken code templates

After upgrading MediaWiki to version 1.22.0, the wiki will not parse wiki syntax or HTML code inside Template:bc and Template:hc anymore, rendering them as plain text. This has broken many templates around, especially those that were using '' and ''' for highlighting parts of code with italic or bold. Please help fixing them, guidelines for dealing with the various cases are a work in progress.

— Kynikos (talk) 11:39, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
2013/08/05 - New maintainer

A new user, Lahwaacz, has joined the official Maintenance Team: our community is thankful for the quality and accuracy of his contributions.

— Kynikos (talk) 10:28, 5 August 2013 (UTC)
2013/06/15 - New maintainer

The official Maintenance Team sees the addition of a new member: thank you Flu, your commitment will be of great help for our wiki.

— Kynikos (talk) 13:52, 15 June 2013 (UTC)
2013/05/02 - New administrator

The ArchWiki proudly welcomes a new administrator, Fengchao, whose passionate dedication to our community we have been able to witness over the past several months: thank you! We are confident this will give our beloved, ever-growing wiki an important help in maintenance and moderation for the times to come.

— Kynikos (talk) 11:01, 2 May 2013 (UTC)
2012/06/11 - Changes in internationalization

In the next few days Template:I18n will be deprecated and replaced by interlanguage links (e.g. [[en:Title]]) also for the languages hosted locally. This operation will be completely performed by a bot, please do not attempt to "help" it with manual edits, as it is necessary to follow a particular procedure and you would risk compromising its operations. The original discussion is in "Dummy" interlanguage links and deprecation of Template:i18n.

— Kynikos (talk) 21:18, 11 June 2012 (UTC)
2012/06/06 - Maintenance team additions

We announce that also Filam, Emiralle and jstjohn have joined the group of Maintainers: the ArchWiki is thankful for their contributions so far!

— Kynikos (talk) 19:46, 6 June 2012 (UTC)
2012/05/20 - Maintenance team

An official team of users has been created with the purpose of helping supervising the recent changes and fixing the resulting reports. See ArchWiki:Maintenance Team for more information. Thanks to the initial Maintainers (in alphabetical order) AlexanderR, Fengchao, Graysky and Skydiver, who have been chosen for their constant commitment and the accuracy and quality of their work on the ArchWiki.

— Kynikos (talk) 12:47, 20 May 2012 (UTC)
2011/11/01 - Official style guidelines

An official set of style rules is now defined in Help:Style in order to improve the consistency of content formatting among the various articles: all ArchWiki contributors are encouraged to read these guidelines and follow them when editing articles.

— Kynikos 12:14, 1 November 2011 (EDT)
2011/09/20 - Administration team additions

Congratulations to the two newest additions to the ArchWiki administration team: Kynikos and thestinger. Over the past year, both have demonstrated dedication and exceptional judgment in maintaining and improving ArchWiki. Their contributions have undoubtedly helped thousands of (Arch and non-Arch) Linux users and served to render ArchWiki one of the best sources of GNU/Linux documentation on the web. Thank you!

— pointone 15:37, 20 September 2011 (EDT)
2011/05/29 - A reminder

Please completely avoid the use of contractions and keep the language formal. Thanks!

— Misfit138 19:38, 29 May 2011 (EDT)
2010/03/27 - Thank you, ArchWiki contributors

Thanks to everyone for their invaluable contributions to ArchWiki. Its content and reputation have been and continue to be second to none. Please keep the knowledge flowing in.

— Misfit138 12:37, 27 March 2010 (EDT)
2010/01/14 - Internationalization guidelines

As you may have noticed, many articles have been moving around this past month; especially non-English ones. This was due to a recent discussion on the topic of ArchWiki internationalization. As a result, new guidelines have been drafted and a major transition has begun.

For more detail, please see the related forum thread and Help:i18n. Briefly, the following standards have been set:

    Non-English article titles should be of the form Title in English (Language), where "Language" is the localized spelling of the language.
    Localized titles can and should still be created, but only as redirects to the English-named article.
    Template:I18n should be used in place of the old Template:i18n links start, Template:i18n entry, and Template:i18n links end combination.

We hope this does not alienate or inconvenience international users; these changes were made primarily to facilitate wiki maintenance and administration and to simplify inter-language linking. Thanks for all your translations and other contributions thus far, and please continue making ArchWiki the envy of distributions world-wide!

— pointone 23:43, 14 January 2010 (EST)
2009/09/18 - Remember to keep it formal

Please remember to avoid chatty, conversational style throughout the wiki. Also, avoid signing your name to a wiki article or comment therein. Thanks!

— Misfit138 11:36, 18 September 2009 (EDT)
2009/01/04 - Article categories!

Please remember to add your contributed articles to the appropriate category at the top of the page. This will streamline the search process and make use of the Table of contents system in place. Thanks!

— Misfit138 12:33, 4 January 2009 (EST)
2008/09/21 - The finest GNU/Linux distribution wiki

Thanks to your vigilant dedication and contribution, the Arch Linux wiki remains the finest available. It continues to grow and improve in quality daily. Nothing negative to report, just keep up the great work.

— Misfit138 12:55, 21 September 2008 (EDT)
2008/07/22 - Thank you, Arch users

The recent boost in wiki contribution has been nothing short of miraculous. Thanks to everyone contributing and improving ArchWiki. Informative and well written articles, as well as gratuitous translations, are coming in at an alarming rate. Because of you, word is spreading about Arch Linux, its high quality wiki and its excellent community!

— Misfit138 20:28, 22 July 2008 (EDT)
2008/05/01 - Don't just give me the 'how' - give me the 'why'

A wiki is a collection of knowledge, most of which ends up being how-tos, which is to be expected. Let us always remember to add the 'why' to our how-tos. Explanatory information always goes further toward imparting knowledge than does instruction alone. Adding explanatory wiki articles is also welcome. Why not add one if you are qualified?

Thanks for the recent increase in contribution to the wiki! Please keep the knowledge coming.

— Misfit138 12:45, 1 May 2008 (EDT)
2008/04/21 - ArchWiki needs YOU!

In our goal to provide the most exhaustive high-quality documentation, Arch is calling all qualified users to contribute to the wiki. Share your knowledge and help us improve this invaluable free resource.

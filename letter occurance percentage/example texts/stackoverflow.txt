    have you checked to make sure you didn't overwrite the shortcut's key binding? –

    There is no Visual Studio 2018. Please post your version. Use the correct tag with version number if possible. –

I just updated my VSCode to the version you mentioned. The combinations work exactly as you described. It must be something that was changed on your computer.

Go to File => Preferences => Keyboard Shortcuts

(Or press CTRL + K and then CTRL + S)

look for Remove Line Comment. In my settings it still says

If your VSCode has a different keybinding, change it back to what you want.

    check if you have two same combination of keys - one for remove line comment and the other one for transform to uppercase. Remove the latter and everything works again;) –

    I agreed,now i am using Ubuntu 16.04 and everything works well,i think than windows isnt the best solution for web development.Here works properly both CTRL+K CTRL+C for comment and CTRL+U for uncomment. – user9160346

    Hi @GoranIlic thanks for your feedback. I suppose it's then slightly different for different operating systems. I was using windows at the time of answering this question. –

I'm using VS code on Mac, Version: 1.49.0 and I had similar problem. In my case shortcut "cmd + k, cmd + u" made text uppercase. It turned out I have two commands assigned to this shortcut. In "Keyboard Shortcuts" you can also filter by shortcuts (or "Keybindings") by pressing keyboard icon on the right in the search bar, it will record keys:

enter image description here

To fix this, I just changed "Transform to Uppercase" Keybinding to something else as I rarely use it.

    Exactly the same situation here. Should probably be the accepted answer. Switching to another combination of keys is not a solution. –

Take care. Some extensions change the keyboard shortcuts. Take a look in the attached screenshot. I don't know what extension changed mine to Shift + Ctrl + K on Windows.

I recommend instead of using separate shortcuts for add/remove comment to set toggle line/block comment with the same shortcut so it also remove comment when the line/block is commented out:

    editor.action.commentLine
    editor.action.blockComment

Use CTRL+/ for both comment and uncomment.
